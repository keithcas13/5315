      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source technology that allows developers to easily build, manage and secure applications with the help of containers. A container allows a developer to deploy an application with everything that it needs (like libraries used to build it).
      </br>Docker has exploded in popularity over the last 5 years in the software development industry as it made it easier to develop applications without worrying about dependencies on the machines that will be used to deploy them. It also helps support increases in number of users of an application without the need to buy more servers.

      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p>Nginx is an open source web server that is used to host web applications. It is popularity to itâ€™s ability to also act as a reverse proxy server (to direct fulfillment of requests for access to applications by end users), a web accelerator (to reduce website access time) and a load balancer (to serve 1000s of concurrent requests by end users). Nginx is used by thousands of websites including LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. (Source: <a href = "https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-nginx/">here</a>)</p>
      <h2>What is a VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p>A Virtual Machine (VM) is a computer file that behaves like an actual computer, allowing you run another operating system (OS) within another. In other words, it is a computer within a computer; sandboxed (separated) from the computer it is a running on to prevent it from making undesirable changes to it.
      </br>VMs allow you run multiple OS on the same machine, run software designed for another OS and test software on multiple platforms more easily. VMs are especially popular with businesses as they allow employees and vendors to work within their corporate network from any location using any machine, while allowing for easier oversight on use of business resources. One notable disadvantage, however, is that the performance of a VM is not as good as performance of the computer on which it is running.

      <h2>Who is the Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digital Ocean?</h2>
      <p>Digital Ocean is a cloud computing vendor that offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for developers. Hence, it provides them with infrastructure components that are usually present in an on-premises data center, something that would be impossible for a single developer to own and manage on their own.
