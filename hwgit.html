      <h2>What is Git? Why do we need a source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>
      Git is the world&#39;s most popular system used for source code version control, i.e. a set of software tools used to store and manage changes to code written in any project for developing software, or any other technical applications.
      </br>Version Control Systems are essential for any tech team due to the following reasons:
      <ul>
      <li>They contain a complete history of changes made to every source code file</li>
      <li>They enable branching and merging of files, allowing developers to make changes (bug fixes or improvements) to code and test independently, without affecting existing work or others working with him/her</li>
      <li>They make it easier to identify root causes of bugs or problems with code that cause applications to not work the way they should.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project - multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>A <strong>local repo</strong> is on your own computer and contains all files for a team project while working within your own computer.
      </br>A remote repo is a central file system that contains the code written and shared by members of a team.
      </br>Multiple developers can work together on the same project at the same time by using Gitâ€™s features of branching and merging. Hence, a developer would branch the code file written by him/her onto his/her own local repo, and make changes independently. This code file will be merged onto the local repository once it is tested thoroughly, from the existing codebase that is already present in the remote repo.
